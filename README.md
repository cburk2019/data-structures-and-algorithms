# Data Structures and Algorithms

## 301 Code Challenges

My first exposure to code challenges! What a doozy! The first few assignments weren't too bad, the rest of the course, was like trying to pass a test in a foreign language that dissimilar to your native language. I struggled through to say the least. But, as the old saying goes, practice makes better.

## 401 Code Challenges - Data Structures

Data Structures and Algorithms. A difficult topic to conceptualize. A difficult task to implement. But nevertheless, wildly important.

This course has brought a whole new meaning to learning for me. I thought learning derivatives in Calculus was difficult. Data Structures and Algorithms have taken the reigns regarding the most difficult thing I have learned.

Please follow this _[link](./javascript/401/README.md)_ to view, comment, and even try to implement yourself. Let me know if there something that I can do to better increase my implementations of the different data structures and the efficiency of.
