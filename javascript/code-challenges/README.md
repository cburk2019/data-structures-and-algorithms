## Overview

This is my first exposure to code challenges. I am looking forward to learning, challenging myself, and being the best programmer I can be. I am slo nervous, as the questions will sound relatively easy in the English language, but in the JavaScript language, I can see it being rather, foreign.

Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout this course, you will complete a set of daily code challenges. Each set will contain up to ten problems.

### Continuous Testing

The repository contains a folder named `.github` which contains a configuration file that will automatically execute all of your tests when you check in your code to GitHub.

You can see the results of your tests online in the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub
