# Mock Interviews

Mock interviews are a collection of code challenges with whiteboarding code challenges completed with a fellow classmate.

The mock interview is to simulate a real-world interview that we could expect to receive in a real job interview. We are provided 30 minutes each in a pair to conduct the interview and to be interviewed. Below is a list of my mock interviews with appropriate files, tests, and rubric links.
